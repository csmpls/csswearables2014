\subsection{Experiment 1}

Overall, both longer recording times and higher bin size are correlated with higher classifier accuracy. \textit{& what's important to report about this regression?}

The number of bins is positively correlated with training and testing time. While test time grows linearly with the log of the number of bins. \textit{& what's important to report about this regression?}

\subsection{Experiment 2}

   {\epsfig{file = Figures/1-2.png, width = 5.5cm}}
  \caption{Mean best-case accuracy among all subjects compared to number of seconds of data in training set.}
  \label{fig:fig3}
 \end{figure}

 The amount of data on which the classifier is trained is positively correlated with the classifier's accuracy on data from later recordings. \textit{& what's important to report about this regression?} The number of bins in training and testing data is also positively correlated with classifier accuracy. \textit{& what's important to report about this regression?}
