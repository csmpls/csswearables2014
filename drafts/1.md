In this section, we describe the specifications for an open collection platform aimed at field recordings of neural data.

## Scalable

A system that scales neural recordings is unlike traditional web applications (Twitter, Facebook, Youtube) in that each user is expected to produce a much larger volume of data, and to submit that data more frequently. The Neurosky MindWave, a current-generation wireless EEG with a single electrode, produces approximately a megabyte of data every minute. This bitrate will increase linearly with the number of electrodes on the device, so even devices on the immediate horizon may produce up to five times this volume. With each user producing gigabytes of data every day in chronic recording scenarios, the system will not scale well to large number of users.



we need the mp3 of brainwave data
something lossy that allows these data to be easily duplicated and shared

## privacy-preserving

all data need to be anonymized
ideally, a user can revoke access to their data at any time
and can, optionally, require permission for the use of their data

## Decentralized/Distributed

there should be no centralized ownership




# a file format


# a distributed collection system


# the end user
















# specifications



we need the "mp3" of brainwave data. a lossy but acceptable format that allows these data to be easily shared. 

## topics 

### - what that file format might look like ?

big idea here is 'replacing the db with the model'

well, compression, but what does compression mean here? what are "the interesting bits"? does it all depend on the model? or is there some generalizeable way of finding information, a la doing "diffs" on power frequency data? like, wow that frequency bin really peaked on that second, while the rest of those bins hovered around where they were?


### - what would the format on which it's collected look like?

distributed has its advantages!

but privacy is important too!

### - how do we deliver value to people who use this service?

users need to have incentive - something in it for the

now, this collection service can exist separately from the application layer, but it ought to be possible for the application and collection layers to communicate with each other

here we can talk about "delivering a classifier"







 (1) it's not owned by someone and (2) people can revoke access to their data 

tension btwn 1 and 2



ships you back some ML metric based on cloud........constantly refactoring metric │07-21 23:24 --> going back to this idea of classifier instead of a database. │07-21 23:24 --> the cloud just ships you a classifier, rather than the data used to create it.

                      │07-21 23:25 <== you need to collect some of the data but you never need to SEND data




a system by which you need a person's "permission" to unlock the data?


I think the concept of
                       │                minimizing what is in the
                       │                database to the "interesting"
                       │                bits would be dramatically
                       │                helpful for compression
                       │07-21 23:38 --> agreed.
    7-21 23:38 <== upstream, no data matters except the data that doesn't match the



so.........what's the model? does it all depend on the model we're using? or is there some generalizeable way of finding information, a la doing "diffs" on power frequency data? like, wow that frequency bin really peaked on that second, while the rest of those bins hovered around where they were?





take the fully academic approach


        - distributed data stores

        - stuff about DRM maybe

        - statstical signal processing as it applies here - essnetially building a model of a system in some sort of homeostasis, figuring out when something novel happens, and shipping only .... the model .... and the deviation ....
