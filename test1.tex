\abstract{By training machine learning (ML)-based classiers on electroencephalography (EEG) signals, researchers have built applications ranging from brain-controlled keyboards to prosthetic arms and hands. However, BCI systems are notoriously hard to calibrate to users, especially with the sorts of low-cost, ergonomic sensors suitable for use in the wild. \textcolor{red}{\bf In general, we should present the issue of ergonomic and computation as a trade-off}. In this study, we demonstrate a computationally inexpensive technique for achieving effective BCI with a single EEG sensor. We show that this technique can be used to to calibrate 14 healthy subjects to BCI literacy in under fifteen minutes of training. We discuss implications for real-time neural recording and brain-computer interface outside of laboratory environments.}
