\abstract{By training machine learning (ML)-based classiers on electroencephalography (EEG) signals, researchers have built applications ranging from brain-controlled keyboards to prosthetic arms and hands. However, these applications require elaborate scanning caps, which are unwieldy both from an ergonomic perspective and from a computational one, as the data they produce are large in memory and expensive for machine learning classifiers to process. This study seeks to acheive a high-bitrate brain-computer interface (BCI) with a single EEG sensor and minimal computational requirements. We find that a quantization technique employing logarithmically-spaced bins significantly increases the computational speed of a classification-based BCI without great detriment to accuracy. We also find that this technique can be used to build effective mental task classifiers with under a minute of training data per task. We discuss implications for chronic neural recording and brain-computer interface in naturalistic environments.}
