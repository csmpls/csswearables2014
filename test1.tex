\abstract{By training machine learning (ML)-based classiers on electroencephalography (EEG) signals, researchers have built applications ranging from brain-controlled keyboards to prosthetic arms and hands. However, BCI systems are notoriously hard to calibrate to their users, especially with the sorts of low-cost, ergonomic sensors suitable for realistic, out-of-lab settings. In this study, we demonstrate a system for achieving BCI with a single EEG sensor and minimal computational requirements. We simulate the calibration of a binary BCI on 14 healthy subjects, and describe the tradeoffs between computational speed, time needed to calibrate the system, and the accuracy of the resulting BCI. We discuss possibilities for the design of BCIs, and for the use of predictive agents in sensor-driven applications generally.}
